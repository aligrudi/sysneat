SYSNEAT
=======

Sysneat is a small Linux init program.  It is similar to, though much
simpler than, SysVinit: it does not read inittab and, except spawning
two gettys, it does not manage daemons directly.

To install sysneat, either use kernel's init parameter to specify the
address of sysneat, or copy sysneat to /sbin/init.  Also copy
sysneat.sh and rc.local to /etc.  Edit rc.local to configure network,
to set host name, and to start daemons.

+ For reboot: kill -INT 1
+ For poweroff: kill -USR1 1
