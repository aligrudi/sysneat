SYSNEAT
=======

Sysneat is a small Linux init program.

To install sysneat, either use kernel's init parameter to specify the
address of sysneat, or copy sysneat to /sbin/init.  Also copy rc.up,
rc.down, and rc.local to /etc.  Edit rc.local to configure network,
to set host name, and to start daemons.

+ To reboot send SIGINT: kill -INT 1
